Phase 3 – MCU Software Architecture Completed & Stabilised

Today’s work focused on closing Phase 3 properly, aligning documentation with the actual integrated system, and resolving a real-world driver integration issue on the Arduino UNO Q platform.

✅ What was achieved today
1. CAN reception fully validated on hardware

MCP2515 successfully receiving CAN frames from external CAN transmit software

Stable reception confirmed with:

correct CAN IDs and payloads

consistent timing (t_ms) aligned with transmit period

zero receive errors under nominal load

Ring buffer counters verified:

rx_count == push_ok

buf_overflow == 0

rx_error == 0

2. Driver library issue identified and resolved

Initial MCP2515 library blocked during CAN initialization on Arduino UNO Q

Hardware and SPI transport were verified independently (SPI register reads OK)

Issue isolated to library behavior on this platform

Driver replaced with Autowp MCP2515 library

New driver demonstrated:

non-blocking initialization

reliable frame reception

clean error handling

This confirmed the value of treating the driver layer as replaceable in the architecture.

3. Diagnostic output stabilised for UNO Q

Identified that UNO Q Monitor output can interleave text due to RouterBridge transport

Refactored diagnostics to:

assemble full log lines in memory

emit each message in a single print call

rate-limit frame and stats output

Result: clean, readable CAN frame logs suitable for tutorials and debugging

4. Phase 3 documentation fully restructured and finalised

Phase 3 documentation is now split into five clean, single-purpose PDFs:

PDF 3.1 – MCU Responsibilities & Task Design
(architecture only, unchanged by implementation details)

PDF 3.2 – MCP2515 Driver Overview
(driver role, expectations, polling choice for Phase 3)

PDF 3.3 – CAN Receive Loop & Buffering
(polling loop, ring buffer, counters, decoupling)

PDF 3.4 – Timing & Data Integrity
(timestamping strategy, integrity definition, validation via counters)

PDF 3.X – Driver Library Change (Root Cause & Resolution)
(documents the library failure, investigation, and resolution)

All PDFs:

reference MCU.ino for implementation

intentionally avoid embedding source code

preserve architectural intent while documenting real integration learning

5. Phase 3 formally closed

Architecture validated against real hardware behavior

Documentation aligned with implementation

No open technical debt in Phase 3
